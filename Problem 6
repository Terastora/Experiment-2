/*
PROBLEM 6: 
The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence which starts with 0 and 1,
with subsequent numbers of the sequence (called Fibonacci numbers) being the sum of the previous two.
Thus, the first few terms of the sequence are: 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,â€¦
Create a program that will output the NEXT 20 Fibonacci numbers (after 0 and 1) in one line, separated by commas.
See the sample output below:
Fibonacci numbers:
0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233,377,610,987,1597,2584,4181,6765,10946
