/*PROBLEM 2: Write a program that computes a customer’s water bill. The bill includes a P35 water demand
charge plus a consumption(use) charge of P1.10 for every gallon used. Consumption is figured from meter
readings in gallons taken recently and during the previous month. If the customer’s unpaid balance is
greater than 0, a P20 late charge is assessed as well.
