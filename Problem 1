/*PROBLEM 1: 1. An Internet service provider has 3 different subscription packages for its customers:
Package A: For P995/mo 10 hrs of access are provided. Additional hours are P20/hr.
Package B: For P1495/mo 20 hrs of access are provided. Additional hours are P10/hr.
Package C: For P1995/mo of unlimited access is provided.
Write a program that calculates a customerâ€™s monthly bill. It should ask which package the customer has
purchased and how many hours were used. It should then display the total amount due.*/
